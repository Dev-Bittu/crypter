# CRYPTER
Python based programs for encryption, decryption and brute force of various cryptography techniques and ciphers.

#### There are major 3 files in ciphers

##### Encrypt
It will encrypt plain text into cipher text by using key.
for help type:
``` python
python encrypt.py --help
```

##### Decrypt
It will decrypt cipher text into plain text by using key.
for help type:
``` python
python decrypt.py --help
```

##### Brute Force
It will decrypt cipher text into plain text without using key.
for help type:
``` python
python brute_force.py --help
```

# Features
  1. encrypt [plain text -> cipher text]
  2. decrypt [cipher text -> plain text]
  3. brute force [cipher text -> plain text (without using key)]

# Getting Started

### Prerequisites
  1. python module
      - argparse

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dev-Bittu/crypter.git
cd crypter
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# TODO
  1. Add new ciphers.
  2. Improve functionality.
  3. Enhance programm to use less memory.
  4. Improve documentation.
  5. Add README in every cipher.

# About
Python based programs for encryption, decryption and brute force of various cryptography techniques
and ciphers.
This is not a professional python programm, we are constantpy improving it.
I, Bittu, currently learning cryptography and made this repo for practice around various ciphers and encryption techniques.
